![1__lgnEelC3jIc_WGMqQBiCA](https://github.com/Elmouinysaleh/alx-system_engineering-devops/assets/36488900/12af39bb-e4ce-471b-b907-3396b245837f)

## Issue Summary:

**Duration:**  
Start Time: March 3, 2024, 10:00 PM PST  
End Time: March 4, 2024, 2:00 AM PST

**Impact:**  
The outage affected the main service dashboard, resulting in complete unavailability for 50% of users and slow response times for the remaining 50%.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was traced back to an unexpected surge in traffic due to a viral meme shared on social media, overwhelming the server's capacity.

## Timeline:

- **10:00 PM PST:** The issue was detected when monitoring alerts signaled a sudden spike in server load.
- **10:05 PM PST:** Engineers began investigating potential causes, initially suspecting a DDoS attack or hardware failure.
- **10:30 PM PST:** Misleading investigation paths included checking network logs and inspecting firewall configurations, which yielded no significant findings.
- **11:00 PM PST:** The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for further analysis and resolution.
- **12:00 AM PST:** Upon closer examination, it was discovered that the surge in traffic was organic, stemming from a popular meme shared on social media platforms.
- **1:00 AM PST:** The incident was resolved by implementing rate limiting and optimizing server configurations to handle increased traffic.
- **2:00 AM PST:** Normal service functionality was restored, and users experienced improved response times.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

**Root Cause:**  
The surge in traffic from a viral meme exceeded the server's capacity, leading to performance degradation and eventual downtime.

**Resolution:**  
To address the issue, rate limiting mechanisms were implemented to manage incoming requests, and server configurations were optimized to better handle sudden spikes in traffic.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

1. **Implement Scalability Measures:** Ensure the system can dynamically scale resources to accommodate sudden increases in traffic.
2. **Enhance Monitoring:** Improve monitoring capabilities to detect traffic anomalies and performance issues more proactively.
3. **Update Disaster Recovery Plan:** Review and update the disaster recovery plan to include procedures for handling unexpected surges in traffic.
4. **Team Training:** Provide additional training for team members on identifying and mitigating performance-related issues.

**TODO:**
- Implement auto-scaling for server resources.
- Enhance monitoring alerts to include thresholds for traffic spikes.
- Conduct regular disaster recovery drills to test response procedures.

## Conclusion:
The outage highlighted the importance of robust scalability measures and proactive monitoring in ensuring service reliability. By implementing corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the impact of similar incidents in the future and uphold our commitment to delivering a seamless user experience.

*Humorous Addition:*  
To commemorate the event, the team has decided to create a meme of our own: "When the server can't handle the meme, it's time for a scalability scheme!" (accompanied by a funny meme illustrating the situation).
